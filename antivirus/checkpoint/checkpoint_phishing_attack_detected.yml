- name: "Possible Phishing Attack detected by Checkpoint"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems. 
                All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. 
                Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific 
                individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. 
                More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns."
  solution: "Check the logs to define if it is a real phishing attack or a false positive.
        Determine if certain websites or attachment types that can be used for phishing are 
        necessary for business operations and consider blocking access if activity 
        cannot be monitored well or if it poses a significant risk"
