- name: "Eset has detected a possible Trojan"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Trojans are a type of malicious software that disguises itself to hide its true intentions. 
                However, unlike viruses, it cannot spread or infect files on its own. 
                To infiltrate a victim's device, this category of malware relies on other means, such as drive-by downloads,
                exploiting vulnerabilities, downloading by other malicious code, or social engineering techniques. "
  solution: "Download and install an updated antivirus. 
    Disconnect from the internet whether you use an ADSL modem, a network card or a Wi-Fi card. 
    Open your internet browser and clear the cache and cookies. 
    To keep your Internet connection as secure as possible, always use a firewall. 
    Both software and hardware firewalls are great at controlling malicious Internet traffic 
    and can often prevent Trojans from downloading to your computer in the first place."
