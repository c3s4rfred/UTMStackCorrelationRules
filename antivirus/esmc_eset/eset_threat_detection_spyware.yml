- name: "Eset has detected a possible Spyware"
  severity: "High"
  description: "This category covers all applications which send private information without user consent/awareness. 
                Spyware uses tracking functions to send various statistical data such as a list of visited websites, email addresses from the users contact list, or a list of recorded keystrokes.
                The authors of spyware claim that these techniques aim to find out more about users needs and interests and allow better-targeted advertisement. 
                The problem is that there is no clear distinction between useful and malicious applications and no one can be sure that the retrieved information will not be misused. 
                The data obtained by spyware applications may contain security codes, PINs, bank account numbers, etc. 
                Spyware is often bundled with free versions of a program by its author in order to generate revenue or to offer an incentive for purchasing the software. 
                Often, users are informed of the presence of spyware during a programs installation to give them an incentive to upgrade to a paid version without it."
  solution: "Install anti-virus/malware software to keep your PC virus free. Keep your antivirus 
             software up to date. Run regularly scheduled scans with your antivirus software. 
             Keep your operating system up to date. Protect your red."
