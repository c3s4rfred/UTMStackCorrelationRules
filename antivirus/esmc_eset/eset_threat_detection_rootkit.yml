- name: "Eset has detected a possible Rootkit"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Rootkits are malicious programs that grant Internet attackers unlimited access to a system, while concealing their presence. 
                Rootkits, after accessing a system (usually exploiting a system vulnerability), 
                use functions in the operating system to avoid detection by antivirus software: they conceal processes, files and Windows registry data. 
                For this reason, it is almost impossible to detect them using ordinary testing techniques."
  solution: "Read the email twice and note the grammar used in an email before clicking on any links. Phishing email is one of the attacker's favorite weapons. 
            The phishing email causes it to download packages that come with rootkits onto your computer. 
            You should always verify the sender's header and email address before clicking on any link. 
            Also, you should read the email twice as the phishing email has grammatical errors.
            Download authorized computer drivers. Computer drivers are the most common entry point for a rootkit on the target system. 
            Therefore, you should always use only an authorized computer driver.
            Update the OS, browser, and security software. These points may not look the best or may seem illogical. 
            But the user must keep their operating system, browser and anti-rootkit security software up to date to avoid a rootkit attack."
