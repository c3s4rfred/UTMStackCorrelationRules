- name: "Eset has detected a possible Packer"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Packer is a runtime self-extracting executable that rolls up several kinds of malware into a single package.
                The most common packers are UPX, PE_Compact, PKLite and ASPack. 
                The same malware may be detected differently when compressed using a different packer. 
                Packers also have the ability to make their signatures mutate over time, making malware more difficult to detect and remove."
  solution: "Install anti-virus/malware software to keep your PC virus free. Keep your antivirus 
             software up to date. Run regularly scheduled scans with your antivirus software. 
             Keep your operating system up to date. Protect your red."
