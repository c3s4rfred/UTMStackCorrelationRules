- name: "Azure Storage Account Key Regenerated"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Identifies a rotation to storage account access keys in Azure. Regenerating access keys can affect any applications or Azure services that are dependent on the storage account key. Adversaries may regenerate a key as a means of acquiring credentials to access systems and resources. "
  solution: "The password for the user's login keychain can be changed from the user's login password. This increases the complexity for an adversary because they need to know an additional password.Organizations may consider weighing the risk of storing credentials in password stores and web browsers. If system, software, or web browser credential disclosure is a significant concern, technical controls, policy, and user training may be used to prevent storage of credentials in improper locations. It's recommended that you rotate your access keys periodically to help keep your storage account secure. Normal key rotation can be exempted from the rule. An abnormal time frame and/or a key rotation from unfamiliar users, hosts, or locations should be investigated."
