- name: "Azure Global Administrator Role Addition to PIM User"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies an Azure Active Directory (AD) Global Administrator role addition to a Privileged Identity Management (PIM) user account. PIM is a service that enables you to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in an organization. Users who are assigned to the Global administrator role can read and modify any administrative setting in your Azure AD organization. "
  solution: "Do not allow domain administrator accounts to be used for day-to-day operations that may expose them to potential adversaries on unprivileged systems."
