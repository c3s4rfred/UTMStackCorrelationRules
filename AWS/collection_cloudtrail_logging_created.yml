- name: "AWS CloudTrail Log Created"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Identifies the creation of an AWS log trail that specifies the settings for delivery of log data"
  solution: "Configure user permissions groups and roles for access to cloud storage. Implement strict Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls to prevent access to storage solutions except for the applications, users, and services that require access. Ensure that temporary access tokens are issued rather than permanent credentials, especially when access is being granted to entities outside of the internal security boundary."
