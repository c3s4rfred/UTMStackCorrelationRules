- name: "AWS EC2 VM Export Failure"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Identifies an attempt to export an AWS EC2 instance. A virtual machine (VM) export may indicate an attempt to extract or exfiltrate information"
  solution: "Implement network-based filtering restrictions to prohibit data transfers to untrusted VPCs. Consider rotating access keys within a certain number of days to reduce the effectiveness of stolen credentials. Limit user account and IAM policies to the least privileges required. Consider using temporary credentials for accounts that are only valid for a certain period of time to reduce the effectiveness of compromised accounts."
