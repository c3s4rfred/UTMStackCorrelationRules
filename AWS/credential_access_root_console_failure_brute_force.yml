- name: "AWS Management Console Brute Force of Root User Identity"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies a high number of failed authentication attempts to the AWS management console for the Root user identity. An adversary may attempt to brute force the password for the Root user identity, as it has complete access to all services and resources for the AWS account"
  solution: "Use multi-factor authentication. Where possible, also enable multi-factor authentication on externally facing services. Refer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies. Proactively reset accounts that are known to be part of breached credentials either immediately, or after detecting bruteforce attempts"
