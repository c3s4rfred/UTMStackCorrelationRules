  description: "Identifies the export of an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) Aurora database snapshot"
  solution: "Implement network-based filtering restrictions to prohibit data transfers to untrusted VPCs. Consider rotating access keys within a certain number of days to reduce the effectiveness of stolen credentials. Limit user account and IAM policies to the least privileges required. Consider using temporary credentials for accounts that are only valid for a certain period of time to reduce the effectiveness of compromised accounts. Exporting snapshots may be done by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. Snapshot exports from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule."
