- name: "AWS IAM Brute Force of Assume Role Policy"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies a high number of failed attempts to assume an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. IAM roles are used to delegate access to users or services. An adversary may attempt to enumerate IAM roles in order to determine if a role exists before attempting to assume or hijack the discovered role"
  solution: "Proactively reset accounts that are known to be part of breached credentials either immediately, or after detecting bruteforce attempts."
