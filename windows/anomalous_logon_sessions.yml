# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Windows: Anomalous logon sessions"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "This correlation rule is triggered when a logon event (Event ID 4624) is detected where the logon type is 9. 
                Logon type 9 corresponds to a network logon using delegated credentials (such as a service that authenticates with client credentials)"
  solution: "Upon activation of this rule, a thorough investigation should be performed to verify the authenticity of the type 9 login. 
            Identify the source of the network login and ensure that it corresponds to legitimate or authorized activity. 
            Keep a continuous watch on type 9 logins and other related events to detect anomalous patterns. 
            If you determine that the login is malicious or unauthorized, revoke the associated credentials and take appropriate corrective action to safeguard system security."
