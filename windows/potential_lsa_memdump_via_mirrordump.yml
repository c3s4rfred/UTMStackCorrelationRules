- name: "Windows: Potential Credential Access via DuplicateHandle in LSASS"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies suspicious access to an LSASS handle via DuplicateHandle. This may indicate
                an attempt to bypass the NtOpenProcess API to evade detection and dump LSASS memory for credential access."
  solution: "Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials. Prioritize privileged accounts.
      Isolate involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take measures to avoid reinfection through the same vector."
