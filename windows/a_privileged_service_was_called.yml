# Rule version v1.0.3

- name: "Windows: A privileged service was called"
  severity: "High"
  description: "The SeTcbPrivilege permission allows a process to act as part of the operating system, 
                granting extensive privileges and control over the system. If an unauthorized process gets this permission, 
                it could compromise system security and perform dangerous or malicious actions with elevated privileges."
  solution: "Given this scenario, it is important to carefully investigate and review event logs, as well as take steps to 
            identify the cause and remediate any potential vulnerabilities or security issues in the system."
