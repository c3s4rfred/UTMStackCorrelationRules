# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Potential DNS Tunneling via NsLookup"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "This rule identifies a large number of nslookup.exe executions with an explicit query type from the same host. This
                may indicate command and control activity utilizing the DNS protocol."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior. Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).
      Implement any temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation required to contain the attack. Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Update firewall rules to be more restrictive. Reimage the host operating system or restore the compromised files to clean versions.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
