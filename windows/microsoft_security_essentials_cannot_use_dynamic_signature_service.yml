- name: "Windows: Microsoft security essentials - Cannot use dynamic signature service"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Detects events in which Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), Microsoft's antivirus software, cannot use the dynamic signature service. 
                The Dynamic Signature Service is an important feature that allows you to update MSE and download new virus and malware definitions to stay up-to-date against the latest threats. 
                If the dynamic signature service cannot be used, it can result in poor protection against new threats and malware."
  solution: "It is recommended to verify Internet connectivity and ensure that the computer has adequate access to Microsoft servers to download signature updates.
            Check your firewall configuration and ensure that it is not blocking outbound traffic required for MSE definition update.
            Update Microsoft Security Essentials to the latest version available to fix possible compatibility issues or known bugs.
            Check the status of the dynamic signing service on Microsoft servers to ensure that it is up and running and not experiencing technical issues.
            If problems persist, consider contacting Microsoft Support for additional assistance and troubleshooting more complex issues."
