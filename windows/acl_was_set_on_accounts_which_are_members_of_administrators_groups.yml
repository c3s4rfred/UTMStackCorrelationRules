# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: The ACL was set on accounts which are members of administrators groups"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "This rule detects changes to the Access Control Lists (ACLs) of accounts that are members of administrator groups on the system. 
                Changes to the ACLs on these highly privileged accounts can indicate potential privilege escalation attempts or unauthorized actions that could compromise system security."
  solution: "We recommend reviewing and validating the ACL settings on the affected accounts, ensuring that the changes are legitimate and made by authorized administrators. 
            Verify that the changes are adequately documented and that the established security policies are complied with. If suspicious or unauthorized changes are detected, 
            take corrective action, revoke unwanted permissions, and restore original ACL settings."
