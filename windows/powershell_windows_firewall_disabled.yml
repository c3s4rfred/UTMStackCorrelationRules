# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows Firewall Disabled via PowerShell"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies when the Windows Firewall is disabled using PowerShell cmdlets, which can help attackers evade network
                constraints, like internet and network lateral communication restrictions."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Re-enable the firewall with its desired configurations.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
