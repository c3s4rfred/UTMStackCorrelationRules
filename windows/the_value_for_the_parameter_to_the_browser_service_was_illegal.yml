  description: "Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in client applications to execute code. 
                Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. 
                Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. 
                Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution 
                on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. 
                Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, 
                so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility"
  solution: "Browser sandboxes can be used to mitigate some of the impact of exploitation, but sandbox escapes may still exist. 
      Other types of virtualization and application microsegmentation may also mitigate the impact of client-side exploitation. 
      Risks of additional exploits and weaknesses in those systems may still exist. 	
      Security applications that look for behavior used during exploitation such as Windows Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG) 
      and the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to mitigate some exploitation behavior."
