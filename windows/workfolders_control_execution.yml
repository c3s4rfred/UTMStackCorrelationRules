# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Signed Proxy Execution via MS Work Folders"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies the use of Windows Work Folders to execute a potentially masqueraded control.exe file in the current working
                directory. Misuse of Windows Work Folders could indicate malicious activity."
  solution: "solate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Review the Work Folders synced share to determine if the control.exe was shared and if so remove it.
      If no lateral movement was identified during investigation, take the affected host offline if possible and remove the
      control.exe binary as well as any additional artifacts identified during investigation.
      Review integrating Windows Information Protection (WIP) to enforce data protection by encrypting the data on PCs using Work Folders.
      Confirm with the user whether this was expected or not, and reset their password"
