- name: "Windows: Volume Shadow Copy Service: COM+ database corrupted, writers will not receive events"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Adversaries may create or modify Windows services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. 
                When Windows boots up, it starts programs or applications called services that perform background system functions. 
                Windows service configuration information, including the file path to the service is executable or recovery programs/commands, is stored in the Windows Registry."
  solution: "Use auditing tools capable of detecting privilege and service abuse opportunities on systems within an enterprise and correct them.	
      Enforce registration and execution of only legitimately signed service drivers where possible.	
      Limit privileges of user accounts and groups so that only authorized administrators can interact with service changes and service configurations."
