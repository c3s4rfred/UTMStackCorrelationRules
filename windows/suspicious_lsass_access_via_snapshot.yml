- name: "Windows: Potential LSASS Memory Dump via PssCaptureSnapShot"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies suspicious access to an LSASS handle via PssCaptureSnapShot where two successive process accesses are performed
                by the same process and target two different instances of LSASS. This may indicate an attempt to evade detection and
                dump LSASS memory for credential access."
  solution: "Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business
      systems, and web services. Prioritize privileged accounts.
      Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
