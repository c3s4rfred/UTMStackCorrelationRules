# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Multiple Logon Failure Followed by Logon Success"
  severity: "High"
  description: "This rule is triggered when a sequence of multiple failed login attempts followed immediately by a successful login from the same IP address or source is detected. 
                This unusual sequence of events may indicate a possible unauthorized access attempt using a brute force or password guessing technique. 
                The purpose of this rule is to identify suspicious patterns of login activity and alert you to potential unauthorized access attempts."
  solution: "We recommend blocking the suspicious IP address and strengthening the passwords of the accounts involved. 
            Additionally, you should closely monitor login activity and consider implementing lockout policies for accounts that experience multiple failed attempts. 
            Early detection and rapid response can help prevent brute force attacks and protect the system against potential unauthorized access."
