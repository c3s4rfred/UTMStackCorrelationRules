# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Windows: PowerShell Share Enumeration Script"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Detects scripts that contain PowerShell functions, structures, or Windows API functions related to windows share
                enumeration activities. Attackers, mainly ransomware groups, commonly identify and inspect network shares, looking for
                critical information for encryption and/or exfiltration."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
        Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
        identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
        Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
        Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.
        Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software."
