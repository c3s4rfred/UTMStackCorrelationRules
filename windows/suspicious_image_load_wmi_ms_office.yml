- name: "Windows: Suspicious WMI Image Load from MS Office"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Identifies a suspicious image load (wmiutils.dll) from Microsoft Office processes. This behavior may indicate
                adversarial activity where child processes are spawned via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). This technique can
                be used to execute code and evade traditional parent/child processes spawned from Microsoft Office products."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
