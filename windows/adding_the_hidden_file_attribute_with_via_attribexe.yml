# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Hiding files with attrib.exe"
  severity: "High"
  description: "This correlation rule detects events where the attrib.exe tool is used to hide files on the system. 
                Cloaking files using this tool can be an indicator of suspicious or malicious activity, 
                as it could be used by malicious actors to evade detection and hide their presence on the system."
  solution: "When detecting events that indicate the use of attrib.exe to hide files, 
            a thorough investigation is necessary to determine the nature of the action and the intent behind it. 
            Verify if the modification of attributes is legitimate and carried out by authorized users. 
            In case of detecting unauthorized changes, identify and delete hidden files and take measures to prevent malicious actions."
