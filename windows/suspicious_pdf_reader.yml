# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Suspicious PDF Reader Child Process"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Identifies suspicious child processes of PDF reader applications. These child processes are often launched via
                exploitation of PDF applications or social engineering."
  solution: "Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.
      Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.
      Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware. Stop suspicious processes.
      Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).
      Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.
      Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.
      Run a full scan using the antimalware tool in place. This scan can reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.
      If the malicious file was delivered via phishing: Block the email sender from sending future emails.
      Block the malicious web pages. Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes. Consider improvements to the security awareness program."
