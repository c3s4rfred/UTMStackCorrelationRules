- name: "Windows: Printer driver failed to load, possible remote code execution using PrinterNightmare exploit: CVE-2021-34527"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Adversaries may exploit remote services to gain unauthorized access to internal systems once inside of a network. 
                Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, 
                service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. 
                A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system."
  solution: "Disable or Remove Feature or Program	Minimize available services to only those that are necessary.
      Security applications that look for behavior used during exploitation can be used to mitigate some exploitation behavior.
      Control flow integrity checking is another way to potentially identify and stop a software exploit from occurring.  
      Many of these protections depend on the architecture and target application binary for compatibility and may not work for all software or services targeted.	
      Segment networks and systems appropriately to reduce access to critical systems and services to controlled methods. Minimize permissions and access for service accounts to limit impact of exploitation.	
      Update software regularly by employing patch management for internal enterprise endpoints and servers."
