# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Windows: The system stopped responding, crashed or lost power unexpectedly"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Adversaries may stop or disable services on a system to render those services unavailable to legitimate users. 
                Stopping critical services or processes can inhibit or stop response to an incident 
                or aid in the adversarys overall objectives to cause damage to the environment"
  solution: "Operate intrusion detection, analysis, and response systems on a separate network from the production 
      environment to lessen the chances that an adversary can see and interfere with critical response functions.
      Ensure proper process and file permissions are in place to inhibit adversaries from disabling or interfering with critical services.
      Ensure proper registry permissions are in place to inhibit adversaries from disabling or interfering with critical services.
      Limit privileges of user accounts and groups so that only authorized administrators can interact with service changes and service configurations."
