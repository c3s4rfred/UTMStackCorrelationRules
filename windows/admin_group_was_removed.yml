  severity: "High"
  description: "This alert is generated every time an administrative group is removed. This event generates on domain controllers, member servers, and workstations"
  solution: "When an alert is generated, it is essential to immediately investigate the removal of the administrator group. 
            Verify if the action was authorized and performed by legitimate administrators. 
            If the unauthorized deletion is confirmed, you should immediately restore the administrators group and assess any potential damage caused by this unwanted action. 
            Additionally, review and enforce security of the environment to prevent unauthorized changes to administrator group membership and limit access to administrator accounts to authorized users only."
