- name: "Windows: Potential Privileged Escalation via SamAccountName Spoofing"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies a suspicious computer account name rename event, which may indicate an attempt to exploit CVE-2021-42278 to
                elevate privileges from a standard domain user to a user with domain admin privileges. CVE-2021-42278 is a security
                vulnerability that allows potential attackers to impersonate a domain controller via samAccountName attribute spoofing."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
