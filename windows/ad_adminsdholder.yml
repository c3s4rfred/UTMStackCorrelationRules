# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Changes to AdminSDHolder"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "This rule detects changes to the AdminSDHolder object within the Active Directory. 
                The AdminSDHolder object is critical to maintaining the ACLs of highly privileged accounts and groups in the domain. 
                Any unexpected modification to this object could indicate a privilege escalation attempt or malicious action."
  solution: "Review the event log to verify the validity of detected changes to the AdminSDHolder object. 
            Verify if the changes were made by authorized administrators and if they conform to the established security policies. 
            In case of suspicious or unauthorized changes, take corrective action, restore the object's original configuration, 
            and strengthen the protection of the AdminSDHolder object."
