# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Windows: Multiple Vault Web Credentials Read"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Windows Credential Manager allows you to create, view, or delete saved credentials for signing into websites, connected
                applications, and networks. An adversary may abuse this to list or dump credentials stored in the Credential Manager for
                saved usernames and passwords. This may also be performed in preparation of lateral movement."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Determine if other hosts were compromised.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Reimage the host operating system or restore the compromised files to clean versions.
      Ensure that the machine has the latest security updates and is not running unsupported Windows versions."
