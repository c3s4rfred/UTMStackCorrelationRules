# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Suspicious CertUtil Commands"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies suspicious commands being used with certutil.exe. CertUtil is a native Windows component which is part of
                Certificate Services. CertUtil is often abused by attackers to live off the land for stealthier command and control or
                data exfiltration."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
