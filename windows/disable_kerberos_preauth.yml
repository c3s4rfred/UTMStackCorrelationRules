  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies the modification of an accounts Kerberos pre-authentication options. An adversary with GenericWrite/GenericAll rights over
                the account can maliciously modify these settings to perform offline password cracking attacks such as AS-REP roasting"
  solution: "Reset the target accounts password if there is any risk of TGTs having been retrieved.
      Re-enable the preauthentication option or disable the target account.
      Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services."
