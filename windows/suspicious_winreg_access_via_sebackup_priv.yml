- name: "Windows: Suspicious Remote Registry Access via SeBackupPrivilege"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies remote access to the registry using an account with Backup Operators group membership. This may indicate an
                attempt to exfiltrate credentials by dumping the Security Account Manager (SAM) registry hive in preparation for
                credential access and privileges elevation."
  solution: "imit or disable the involved user account to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
