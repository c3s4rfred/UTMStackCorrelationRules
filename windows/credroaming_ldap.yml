- name: "Windows: Modification of the msPKIAccountCredentials"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identify the modification of the msPKIAccountCredentials attribute in an Active Directory User Object. Attackers can abuse
                the credentials roaming feature to overwrite an arbitrary file for privilege escalation. ms-PKI-AccountCredentials
                contains binary large objects (BLOBs) of encrypted credential objects from the credential manager store, private keys,
                certificates, and certificate requests."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.
      If the malicious file was delivered via phishing:
      Block the email sender from sending future emails. Block the malicious web pages.
      Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes. Consider improvements to the security awareness program.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components."
