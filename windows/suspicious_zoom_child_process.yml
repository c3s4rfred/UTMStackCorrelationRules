- name: "Windows: Zoom Child Process"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "A suspicious Zoom child process was detected, which may indicate an attempt to run unnoticed. Verify process details
                such as command line, network connections, file writes and associated file signature details as well."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
