- name: "Windows: Probable Dos Attack"
  severity: "High"
  description: "A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to the intended users.
                One common method of attack involves saturating the target machine with external communications requests so that it cannot
                respond to legitimate traffic or the machine responds so slowly that it is essentially useless."
  solution: "This event can be a sign of ICMP DoS attack or, among other things, hardware or network device related problems. In both cases, we recommend you to investigate the reason the event was generated."
