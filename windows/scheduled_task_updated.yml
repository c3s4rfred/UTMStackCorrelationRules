# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Windows: A scheduled task was updated"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Indicates the update of a scheduled task using Windows event logs. Adversaries can use these to establish persistence,
                by changing the configuration of a legit scheduled task. Some changes such as disabling or enabling a scheduled task are
                common and may may generate noise."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.
      If the malicious file was delivered via phishing:
      Block the email sender from sending future emails. Block the malicious web pages.
      Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes. Consider improvements to the security awareness program.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components."
