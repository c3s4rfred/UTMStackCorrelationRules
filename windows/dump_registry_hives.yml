- name: "Windows: Credential Acquisition via Registry Hive Dumping"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies attempts to export a registry hive which may contain credentials using the Windows reg.exe tool."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised
      Reimage the host operating system and restore compromised files to clean versions.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
