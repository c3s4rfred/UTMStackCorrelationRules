- name: "Windows: Unusual Child Processes of RunDLL32"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies child processes of unusual instances of RunDLL32 where the command line parameters were suspicious. Misuse of
                RunDLL32 could indicate malicious activity."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
        Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software.
        Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
        identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
        Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
        Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
