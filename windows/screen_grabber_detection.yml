- name: "Windows: Detection of a suspicious PowerShell Script with screenshot capabilities"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Detects PowerShell scripts that can take screenshots, which is a common feature in post-exploitation kits and remote access tools"
  solution: "Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business
      systems, and web services.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and
      malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
