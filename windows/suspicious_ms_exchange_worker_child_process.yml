# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Windows: Microsoft Exchange Worker Spawning Suspicious Processes"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies suspicious processes being spawned by the Microsoft Exchange Server worker process (w3wp). This activity may
                indicate exploitation activity or access to an existing web shell backdoor."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.
      Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.
      Stop suspicious processes. Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).
      Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that
      attackers could use to reinfect the system. Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.
      If the malicious file was delivered via phishing: Block the email sender from sending future emails.
      Block the malicious web pages. Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes.
      Consider improvements to the security awareness program. Reimage the host operating system and restore compromised files to clean versions.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
