# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: NTDS or SAM Database File Copied"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies a copy operation of the Active Directory Domain Database or Security Account Manager (SAM) files.
                Those files contain sensitive information including hashed domain and local credentials."
  solution: "If the host is a domain controller, we recommend reviewing the privileges assigned to users who can access the DCs, to ensure that the principle of least privilege is met.
      followed and reduce the attack surface.
      Isolate involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, systems and web services.
      Run a full anti-malware scan. This can reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take measures to avoid reinfection through the same vector."
