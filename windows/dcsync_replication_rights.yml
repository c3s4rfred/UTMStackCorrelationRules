# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Potential Credential Access via DCSync"
  severity: "High"
  description: "This rule identifies when a User Account starts the Active Directory Replication Process. Attackers can use the DCSync
                technique to get credential information of individual accounts or the entire domain, thus compromising the entire
                domain."
  solution: "If specific credentials were compromised reset the password for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials
      If the entire domain was compromised, perform a password reset.
      Investigate how the attacker escalated privileges and identify the systems used to make the lateral move. use this
      information to determine ways the attacker could use to regain access to the environment.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take measures to avoid reinfection through the same vector."
