# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Potential Invoke-Mimikatz PowerShell Script"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Mimikatz is a credential dumper capable of obtaining plaintext Windows account logins and passwords, along with many
                other features that make it useful for testing the security of networks. This rule detects Invoke-Mimikatz PowerShell
                script and alike."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Look into preventing access to `LSASS` using capabilities such as LSA protection or antivirus/EDR tools that provide this capability.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
