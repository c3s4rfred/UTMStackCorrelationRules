- name: "Windows: Privilege Escalation via Rogue Named Pipe Impersonation"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies a privilege escalation attempt via rogue named pipe impersonation. An adversary may abuse this technique by
                masquerading as a known named pipe and manipulating a privileged process to connect to it."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
