- name: "Windows: Probable defense evasion attack, IPsec or Firewall not working"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "The adversary is trying to avoid being detected. Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. 
                Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. 
                Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware. Other tacticsâ€™ techniques are cross-listed 
                here when those techniques include the added benefit of subverting defenses.
                Please see the logs attached to this alert for additional details."
  solution: "Check the state of IPsec Services and Firewall. See the logs to identify if it is a normal behaviour or is an attack."
