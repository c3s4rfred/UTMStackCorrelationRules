# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Disabling Windows Defender Security Settings via PowerShell"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies use of the Set-MpPreference PowerShell command to disable or weaken certain Windows Defender settings."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Based on the command line, take actions to restore the appropriate Windows Defender antivirus configurations.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Review the privileges assigned to the user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
