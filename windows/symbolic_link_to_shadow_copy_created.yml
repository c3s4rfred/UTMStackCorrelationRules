# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Symbolic Link to Shadow Copy Created"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies the creation of symbolic links to a shadow copy. Symbolic links can be used to access files in the shadow
                copy, including sensitive files such as ntds.dit, System Boot Key and browser offline credentials."
  solution: "Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials.
      If the entire domain was compromised you must include a password reset.
      Locate and delete static files copied from Shadow Volume Copies.
      The mklink command line tool should require administrative access by default unless you are in developer mode.
      Run a full anti-malware scan. This can reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take measures to avoid reinfection through the same vector."
