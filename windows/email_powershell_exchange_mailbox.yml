# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Detection of Exchange mail exported through PowerShell"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "This rule identifies the use of an Exchange PowerShell cmdlet, which is used to export the contents of a core file.
                mailbox or archive to a .pst file. Adversaries can target user email to collect sensitive information."
  solution: "Check if the host involved is the Exchange server, if it is, isolate it. Remove fully or partially completed export requests.
        Investigate if credential exposure occurred on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure that all compromised accounts are
        identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials.
        Review the privileges of users with the mailbox import and export privilege to ensure that the principle of least privilege is followed."
