# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Windows: New Windows Service Created to start from windows root path. Suspicious event as the binary may have been dropped using Windows Admin Shares"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Adversaries may use Valid Accounts to interact with a remote network share using Server Message Block (SMB). 
                The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user."
  solution: "Consider using the host firewall to restrict file sharing communications such as SMB. 	
      Consider disabling Windows administrative shares. Do not reuse local administrator account passwords across systems. 
      Ensure password complexity and uniqueness such that the passwords cannot be cracked or guessed. 
      Deny remote use of local admin credentials to log into systems. Do not allow domain user accounts to be in the local Administrators group multiple systems."
