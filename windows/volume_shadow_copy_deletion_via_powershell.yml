# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Volume Shadow Copy Deletion via PowerShell"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies the use of the Win32_ShadowCopy class and related cmdlets to achieve shadow copy deletion. This commonly
                occurs in tandem with ransomware or other destructive attacks."
  solution: "- Consider isolating the involved host to prevent destructive behavior, which is commonly associated with this activity.
      Priority should be given due to the advanced stage of this activity on the attack.
      If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.
      Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware.
      Stop suspicious processes. Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).
      Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that
      attackers could use to reinfect the system.
      Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.
      If data was encrypted, deleted, or modified, activate your data recovery plan.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Perform data recovery locally or restore the backups from replicated copies (cloud, other servers, etc.).
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
