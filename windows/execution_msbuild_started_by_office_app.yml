# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Microsoft Build Engine Started by an Office Application"
  severity: "High"
  description: "An instance of MSBuild, the Microsoft Build Engine, was started by Excel or Word. This is unusual behavior for the Build
                Engine and could have been caused by an Excel or Word document executing a malicious script payload."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, systems and web services.
      If triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts. Implement temporary rules, procedures and network segmentation to contain malware.
      Stop suspicious processes. Immediately block identified Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).
      Inspect affected systems for additional malware backdoors, such as reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that
      attackers could use to re-infect the system. Eliminate and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.
      Run a full scan with the anti-malware tool installed. This scan may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take measures to avoid reinfection through the same vector. If the malicious file was delivered via phishing,
      block the email sender from sending future emails, block malicious web pages, remove sender emails from mailboxes."
