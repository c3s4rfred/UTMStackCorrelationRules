- name: "Windows: An administrative account was deleted"
  severity: "High"
  description: "This alert is generated every time a user account is deleted. This event generates on domain controllers, member servers, and workstations"
  solution: "When an alert is generated, the deletion of the administrator account should be investigated immediately. 
            Verify if the action was authorized and performed by legitimate administrators. 
            If the unauthorized deletion is confirmed, you should immediately restore the administrator account and assess any potential damage caused by this unwanted action. 
            Additionally, review and enforce security of the environment to prevent unauthorized changes to administrator group membership and limit access to administrator accounts to authorized users only."
