# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Process Activity via Compiled HTML File"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Compiled HTML files (.chm) are commonly distributed as part of the Microsoft HTML Help system. Adversaries may conceal
                malicious code in a CHM file and deliver it to a victim for execution. CHM content is loaded by the HTML Help executable
                program (hh.exe)."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
