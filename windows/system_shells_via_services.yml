# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: System Shells via Services"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Windows services typically run as SYSTEM and can be used as a privilege escalation opportunity. Malware or penetration
                testers may run a shell as a service to gain SYSTEM permissions."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Delete the service or restore it to the original configuration.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
