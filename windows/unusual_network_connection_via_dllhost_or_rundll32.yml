- name: "Windows: Unusual Network Connection via DllHost or via RunDLL32"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies unusual instances of dllhost.exe making outbound network connections. This may indicate adversarial Command
                and Control activity. Identifies unusual instances of rundll32.exe making outbound network connections. This may indicate adversarial Command
                and Control activity."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Run a full scan using the antimalware tool in place. This scan can reveal additional artifacts left in the system,
      persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.
      Review the privileges assigned to the user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed."
