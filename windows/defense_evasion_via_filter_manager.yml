- name: "Windows: Potential Evasion via Filter Manager"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "The Filter Manager Control Program (fltMC.exe) binary may be abused by adversaries to unload a filter driver and evade
                defenses"
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Run a full scan using the antimalware tool in place. This scan can reveal additional artifacts left in the system,
      persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.
      Review the privileges assigned to the user to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed."
