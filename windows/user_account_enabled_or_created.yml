# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Windows: User account created"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Adversaries can manipulate accounts to maintain access to victim systems.
                These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert policies
                such as performing iterative password updates to bypass policies
                password lifetime and preserve the life of compromised credentials."
  solution: "We recommend that you use multi-factor authentication for privileged users and accounts.
      Configure access controls and firewalls to limit access to critical systems and domain controllers.
      Make sure low-privileged user accounts don't have permissions to modify accounts
      or account-related policies."
