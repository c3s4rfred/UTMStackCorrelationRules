  severity: "High"
  description: "This alert is generated every time a user account is removed from administrations groups. This event generates on domain controllers, member servers, and workstations"
  solution: "When an alert is generated, it is essential to immediately investigate the removal of the user from the administrators group. 
            Verify if the action was authorized and performed by legitimate administrators. 
            If the deletion was unauthorized, immediately restore the user to the administrators group and assess any potential impact caused by this unwanted action. 
            Also, review and enforce the security of the environment to prevent unauthorized changes to the membership of the administrators group."
