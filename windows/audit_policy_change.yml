# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Windows audit policy changed"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "This rule is triggered when a Windows audit policy change is detected. 
                The audit policy in Windows allows you to configure what events and activities should be audited on the system, 
                including monitoring and logging of important actions that occur on the system. 
                This change may indicate an unauthorized modification to the auditing configuration, 
                which may have security implications and require immediate review."
  solution: "Following the generation of this alert, it is essential to investigate the audit 
            policy change to determine if it was authorized or if it may be the result of malicious activity. 
            Identify what changes were made and who made them. If the change was not authorized or is not justified, 
            revert the configuration to a safe state and review security measures to prevent future unauthorized changes. 
            It is important to track audit policy changes to ensure effective control of system security."
