- name: "Windows: Potential Process Injection via PowerShell"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Detects the use of Windows API functions that are commonly abused by malware and security tools to load
                malicious code or inject it into remote processes."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
        Restrict PowerShell usage outside of IT and engineering business units using GPOs, AppLocker, Intune, or similar software.
        Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
        identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
        Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
        Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
