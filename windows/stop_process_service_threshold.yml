# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: High Number of Process and/or Service Terminations"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "This rule identifies a high number (10) of process terminations (stop, delete, or suspend) from the same host within a
                short time period."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further destructive behavior, which is commonly associated with this activity.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Reimage the host operating system or restore it to the operational state.
      If any other destructive action was identified on the host, it is recommended to prioritize the investigation and look
      for ransomware preparation and execution activities.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
