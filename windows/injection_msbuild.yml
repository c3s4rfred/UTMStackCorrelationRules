# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows: Process Injection by the Microsoft Build Engine"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "An instance of MSBuild, the Microsoft Build Engine, created a thread in another process. This technique is sometimes
                used to evade detection or elevate privileges."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
