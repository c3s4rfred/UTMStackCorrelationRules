- name: "Windows: Clearing Windows Console History"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies when a user attempts to clear console history. An adversary may clear the command history of a compromised
                account to conceal the actions undertaken during an intrusion."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, systems and web services.
      Run a full anti-malware scan. This can reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take measures to avoid reinfection through the same vector.
      Ensure PowerShell audit policies and log collection are in place to provide future visibility."
