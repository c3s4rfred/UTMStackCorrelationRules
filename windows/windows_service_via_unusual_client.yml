# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Windows Service Installed via an Unusual Client"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies the creation of a Windows service by an unusual client process. Services may be created with administrator
                privileges but are executed under SYSTEM privileges, so an adversary may also use a service to escalate privileges from
                administrator to SYSTEM."
  solution: "Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Review the privileges assigned to the involved users to ensure that the least privilege principle is being followed.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
