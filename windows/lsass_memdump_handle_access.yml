# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "LSASS Memory Dump Handle Access"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Identifies handle requests for the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) object access with
                specific access masks that many tools with a capability to dump memory to disk use (0x1fffff, 0x1010, 0x120089).
                This rule is tool agnostic as it has been validated against a host of various LSASS dump tools such as SharpDump,
                Procdump, Mimikatz, Comsvcs etc. It detects this behavior at a low level and does not depend on a specific tool or dump
                file name."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Scope compromised credentials and disable the accounts.
      If the triage identified malware, search the environment for additional compromised hosts.
      Implement temporary network rules, procedures, and segmentation to contain the malware. Stop suspicious processes.
      Immediately block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).
      Inspect the affected systems for additional malware backdoors like reverse shells, reverse proxies, or droppers that attackers could use to reinfect the system.
      Remove and block malicious artifacts identified during triage.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
