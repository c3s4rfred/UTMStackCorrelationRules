- name: "Windows: Suspicious Image Load (taskschd.dll) from MS Office"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Identifies a suspicious image load (taskschd.dll) from Microsoft Office processes. This behavior may indicate
                adversarial activity where a scheduled task is configured via Windows Component Object Model (COM). This technique can
                be used to configure persistence and evade monitoring by avoiding the usage of the traditional Windows binary
                (schtasks.exe) used to manage scheduled tasks."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.
      If the malicious file was delivered via phishing:
      Block the email sender from sending future emails. Block the malicious web pages.
      Remove emails from the sender from mailboxes. Consider improvements to the security awareness program.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components."
