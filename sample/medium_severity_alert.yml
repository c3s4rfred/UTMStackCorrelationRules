# Rule version v1.0.2

- name: "Alert Sample Severity Medium"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "This is an example of a medium-severity alert generated by UTMStack. 
                Its purpose is to illustrate how a real alert looks like and give you something to practice with during the tutorial."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Implement network-based filtering restrictions to prohibit data transfers to untrusted VPCs.</li>
    <li>Consider rotating access keys within a certain number of days to reduce the effectiveness of stolen credentials.</li>
    <li>Limit user account and IAM policies to the least privileges required. Consider using temporary credentials for accounts that are only valid for a certain period of time to reduce the effectiveness of compromised accounts.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> A new transport rule may be created by a system or network administrator. Verify that the configuration change was
    expected. Exceptions can be added to this rule to filter expected behavior."
