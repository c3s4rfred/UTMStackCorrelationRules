- name: "Microsoft 365 Detection of a connection to a .onion domain"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Tor is a software suite and network that provides increased anonymity on the Internet. 
                It creates a multi-hop proxy network and utilizes multilayer encryption to 
                protect both the message and routing information. Tor utilizes Onion Routing, 
                in which messages are encrypted with multiple layers of encryption; at each step in the proxy network, 
                the topmost layer is decrypted and the contents forwarded on to the next node until it reaches its destination."
  solution: "We recommend reviewing the logs, and verifying the users that have connected to .onion domains"
