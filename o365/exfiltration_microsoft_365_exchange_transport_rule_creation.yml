- name: "Microsoft 365 Exchange Transport Rule Creation"
  severity: Medium
  description: "Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network. Once theyâ€™ve collected data, adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it. This can include compression and encryption. Techniques for getting data out of a target network typically include transferring it over their command and control channel or an alternate channel and may also include putting size limits on the transmission.<br>
    Identifies a transport rule creation in Microsoft 365. Exchange Online mail transport rules should be set to not forward email to domains outside of your organization as a best practice. An adversary may create transport rules to exfiltrate data."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Implement network-based filtering restrictions to prohibit data transfers to untrusted VPCs.</li>
    <li>Consider rotating access keys within a certain number of days to reduce the effectiveness of stolen credentials.</li>
    <li>Limit user account and IAM policies to the least privileges required. Consider using temporary credentials for accounts that are only valid for a certain period of time to reduce the effectiveness of compromised accounts.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> A new transport rule may be created by a system or network administrator. Verify that the configuration change was
    expected. Exceptions can be added to this rule to filter expected behavior."
