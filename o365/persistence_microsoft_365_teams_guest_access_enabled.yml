- name: Microsoft 365 Teams Guest Access Enabled
  severity: Medium
  description: "Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain access to victim systems. Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves adversary access to a 
    compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission groups. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, 
    such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials. In order to create or 
    manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain.<br>
    Identifies when guest access is enabled in Microsoft Teams. Guest access in Teams allows people outside the organization to access teams and channels. An adversary may enable guest access to maintain persistence in an environment. <br> The Microsoft 365 Fleet integration, Filebeat module, or similarly structured data is required to be compatible with this rule."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Use multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts.</li>
    <li>Do not allow domain administrator accounts to be used for day-to-day operations that may expose them to potential adversaries on unprivileged systems.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Teams guest access may be enabled by a system or network administrator. Verify that the configuration change was
    expected. Exceptions can be added to this rule to filter expected behavior."
