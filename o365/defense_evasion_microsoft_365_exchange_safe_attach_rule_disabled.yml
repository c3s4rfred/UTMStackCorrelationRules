- name: "Microsoft 365 Exchange Safe Attachment Rule Disabled"
  severity: Medium
  description: "Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware. Other tacticsâ€™ techniques are cross-listed here when those techniques include the added benefit of subverting defenses.<br>
    Identifies when a safe attachment rule is disabled in Microsoft 365. Safe attachment rules can extend malware
    protections to include routing all messages and attachments without a known malware signature to a special hypervisor
    environment. An adversary or insider threat may disable a safe attachment rule to exfiltrate data or evade defenses."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Ensure proper process and file permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security/logging services.</li>
    <li>Ensure proper Registry permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security/logging services.</li>
    <li>Ensure proper user permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security/logging services.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> A safe attachment rule may be disabled by a system or network administrator. Verify that the configuration change
    was expected. Exceptions can be added to this rule to filter expected behavior."
