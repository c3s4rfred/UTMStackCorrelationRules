- name: "Potential Password Spraying of Microsoft 365 User Accounts"
  severity: Medium
  description: "Credential Access consists of techniques for stealing credentials like account names and passwords. Techniques used to get credentials include keylogging or credential dumping. Using legitimate credentials can give adversaries access to systems, make them harder to detect, and provide the opportunity to create more accounts to help achieve their goals.<br>
    Identifies a high number (25) of failed Microsoft 365 user authentication attempts from a single IP address within 30 minutes, which could be indicative of a password spraying attack. An adversary may attempt a password spraying attack to obtain unauthorized access to user accounts."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Set account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from being guessed. Too strict a policy may create a denial of service condition and render environments un-usable, with all accounts used in the brute force being locked-out.</li>
    <li>Use multi-factor authentication. Where possible, also enable multi-factor authentication on externally facing services.</li>
    <li>Refer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies.</li>
    <li>Proactively reset accounts that are known to be part of breached credentials either immediately, or after detecting bruteforce attempts.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Automated processes that attempt to authenticate using expired credentials and unbounded retries may lead to false positives."
