- name: Microsoft 365 Teams External Access Enabled
  severity: Medium
  description: "Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain access to victim systems. Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves adversary access to a
    compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission groups. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, 
    such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials. In order to create or 
    manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain.<br>
    Identifies when external access is enabled in Microsoft Teams. External access lets Teams and Skype for Business users
    communicate with other users that are outside their organization. An adversary may enable external access or add an
    allowed domain to exfiltrate data or maintain persistence in an environment."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Use multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts.</li>
    <li>Do not allow domain administrator accounts to be used for day-to-day operations that may expose them to potential adversaries on unprivileged systems.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong>  Teams external access may be enabled by a system or network administrator. Verify that the configuration change was
    expected. Exceptions can be added to this rule to filter expected behavior."
