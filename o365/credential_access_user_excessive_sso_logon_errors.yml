- name: "O365 Excessive Single Sign-On Logon Errors"
  severity: Medium
  description: "Credential Access consists of techniques for stealing credentials like account names and passwords. Techniques used to get credentials include keylogging or credential dumping. Using legitimate credentials can give adversaries access to systems, make them harder to detect, and provide the opportunity to create more accounts to help achieve their goals.<br>
    Identifies accounts with a high number of single sign-on (SSO) logon errors. Excessive logon errors may indicate an attempt to brute force a password or SSO token."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Set account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from being guessed. Too strict a policy may create a denial of service condition and render environments un-usable, with all accounts used in the brute force being locked-out.</li>
    <li>Use multi-factor authentication. Where possible, also enable multi-factor authentication on externally facing services.</li>
    <li>Refer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies.</li>
    <li>Proactively reset accounts that are known to be part of breached credentials either immediately, or after detecting bruteforce attempts.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Automated processes that attempt to authenticate using expired credentials and unbounded retries may lead to false positives."
