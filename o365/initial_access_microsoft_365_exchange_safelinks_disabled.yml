- name: "Microsoft 365 Exchange Safe Link Policy Disabled"
  severity: Medium
  description: "When it comes to protecting its users, Microsoft takes the threat of phishing seriously. Spoofing is a common technique that's 
    used by attackers. Spoofed messages appear to originate from someone or somewhere other than the actual source. This technique is often 
    used in phishing campaigns that are designed to obtain user credentials. The anti-spoofing technology in EOP specifically examines forgery of the From header in the message body (used to display the message sender in email clients). When EOP has high confidence that the From header is forged, the message is identified as spoofed.<br>
    Identifies when a Safe Link policy is disabled in Microsoft 365. Safe Link policies for Office applications extend
    phishing protection to documents that contain hyperlinks, even after they have been delivered to a user."
  solution: "
    <ol>
    <li>Anti-virus can automatically quarantine suspicious files.</li>
    <li>Network intrusion prevention systems and systems designed to scan and remove malicious email attachments or links can be used to block activity.</li>
    <li>Determine if certain websites or attachment types (ex: .scr, .exe, .pif, .cpl, etc.) that can be used for phishing are necessary for business operations and consider blocking access if activity cannot be monitored well or if it poses a significant risk.</li>
    <li>Use anti-spoofing and email authentication mechanisms to filter messages based on validity checks of the sender domain (using SPF) and integrity of messages (using DKIM). Enabling these mechanisms within an organization (through policies such as DMARC) may enable recipients (intra-org and cross domain) to perform similar message filtering and validation.</li>
    <li>Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and phishing emails.</li> 
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Disabling safe links may be done by a system or network administrator. Verify that the configuration change was
    expected. Exceptions can be added to this rule to filter expected behavior."
