- name: "GCP probable Persistence, IAM Service Account Key Creation"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, 
                and other interruptions that could cut off their access. Techniques used for persistence include any access, action, or 
                configuration changes that let them maintain their foothold on systems, such as replacing or hijacking legitimate code or 
                adding startup code.<br> 
                Identity users through domain-wide delegation. If private keys are not tracked and managed properly, they can present a 
                security risk. An adversary may create a new key for a service account in order to attempt to abuse the permissions 
                assigned to that account and evade detection."
