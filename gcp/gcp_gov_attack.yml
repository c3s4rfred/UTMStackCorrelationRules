- name: "GCP probable Government-backed attack"
  severity: "High"
  description: "A user's account might have been targeted by government-backed attack. 
                Government-backed attackers are trying to access the account of one of your users. 
                An attack happens to less than 0.1% of all Google Account users. There's a chance the alert is 
                a false alarm. However, we believe we detected activities that government-backed attackers use 
                to try to steal a password or other personal information. Such activity includes the user receiving 
                an email containing a harmful attachment, links to malicious software downloads, or links to fake 
                websites that are designed to access passwords."
  solution: "Secure users account:<ol>
             <li>Reset the password of any account with suspicious activity.</li> 
             <li>We recommend adding and enrolling the user in 2-Step Verification.</li> 
             <li>Ask the user to take additional steps to secure their account.</li>
             <li>See the logs attached to this alert for more information.</li></ol>"
