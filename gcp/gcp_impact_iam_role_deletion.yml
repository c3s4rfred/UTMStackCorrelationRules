- name: "GCP probable Impact, IAM Role Deletion"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or compromise integrity by manipulating business 
                and operational processes. Techniques used for impact can include destroying or tampering with data. In some cases, business 
                processes can look fine, but may have been altered to benefit the adversaries goals. These techniques might be used by 
                adversaries to follow through on their end goal or to provide cover for a confidentiality breach. <br> 
                Identifies an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role deletion in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). A role contains a set 
                of permissions that allows you to perform specific actions on Google Cloud resources. An adversary may delete an IAM 
                role to inhibit access to accounts utilized by legitimate users."

    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Role deletions may be done by a system or network administrator. 
    Role deletions by unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated."
