- name: "GCP probable Initial Access, IAM Role Creation"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Initial Access consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their initial foothold within a network. 
                Techniques used to gain a foothold include targeted spearphishing and exploiting weaknesses on public-facing web servers. 
                Footholds gained through initial access may allow for continued access, like valid accounts and use of external remote services, 
                or may be limited-use due to changing passwords. <br> 
                Identifies an Identity and Access Management (IAM) custom role creation in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Custom roles are 
                user-defined, and allow for the bundling of one or more supported permissions to meet specific needs. Custom roles will 
                not be updated automatically and could lead to privilege creep if not carefully scrutinized."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Verify whether the user email, resource name, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment.</li>
    <li>See the logs attached to this alert for more information.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Custom role creations may be done by a system or network administrator. 
    Role creations by unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated."
