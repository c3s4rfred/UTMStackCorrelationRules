- name: "GCP probable Defense Evasion, Firewall Rule Creation"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. 
                Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or 
                obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes 
                to hide and masquerade their malware. Other tactics are cross-listed here when those techniques 
                include the added benefit of subverting defenses. <br> 
                Identifies when a firewall rule is created in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) firewall 
                rules can be configured to allow or deny connections to or from virtual machine (VM) instances. An adversary may 
                create a new firewall rule in order to weaken their target's security controls and allow more permissive ingress or 
                egress traffic flows for their benefit."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Ensure proper process and file permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security/logging services.</li>
    <li>Ensure proper Registry permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security/logging services.</li>
    <li>Ensure proper user permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security/logging services.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Firewall rules may be created by system administrators. Verify that the firewall configuration change was expected."
