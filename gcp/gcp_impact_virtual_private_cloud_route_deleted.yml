- name: "GCP probable Impact, Virtual Private Cloud Route Deletion"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or compromise integrity by manipulating business 
                and operational processes. Techniques used for impact can include destroying or tampering with data. In some cases, business 
                processes can look fine, but may have been altered to benefit the adversaries goals. These techniques might be used by 
                adversaries to follow through on their end goal or to provide cover for a confidentiality breach. <br> 
                Identifies when a virtual private cloud (VPC) route is deleted in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Google Cloud routes 
                define the paths that network traffic takes from a virtual machine (VM) instance to other destinations. These 
                destinations can be inside a Google VPC network or outside it. An adversary may delete a route in order to impact the 
                flow of network traffic in their target's cloud environment."
