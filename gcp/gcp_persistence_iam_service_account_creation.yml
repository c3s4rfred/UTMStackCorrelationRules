- name: "GCP probable Persistence, IAM Service Account Creation"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, 
                and other interruptions that could cut off their access. Techniques used for persistence include any access, action, or 
                configuration changes that let them maintain their foothold on systems, such as replacing or hijacking legitimate code or 
                adding startup code.<br> 
                Identifies when a new service account is created in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). A service account is a special type of 
                account used by an application or a virtual machine (VM) instance, not a person. Applications use service accounts to 
                make authorized API calls, authorized as either the service account itself, or as G Suite or Cloud Identity users 
                through domain-wide delegation. If service accounts are not tracked and managed properly, they can present a security 
                risk. An adversary may create a new service account to use during their operations in order to avoid using a standard 
                user account and attempt to evade detection."
