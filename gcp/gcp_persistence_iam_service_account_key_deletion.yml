- name: "GCP probable Persistence, IAM Service Account Key Deletion"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, 
                and other interruptions that could cut off their access. Techniques used for persistence include any access, action, or 
                configuration changes that let them maintain their foothold on systems, such as replacing or hijacking legitimate code or 
                adding startup code.<br> 
                Identifies the deletion of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) service account key in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 
                Each service account is associated with two sets of public/private RSA key pairs that are used to authenticate. If a key 
                is deleted, the application will no longer be able to access Google Cloud resources using that key. A security best 
                practice is to rotate your service account keys regularly."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Verify whether the user email, resource name, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment.</li>
    <li>See the logs attached to this alert for more information.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Service account key deletions may be done by a system or network administrator. 
    Key deletions by unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated."
