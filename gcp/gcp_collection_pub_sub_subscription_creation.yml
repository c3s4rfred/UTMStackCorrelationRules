- name: "GCP probable Collection, Pub/Sub Subscription Creation"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Collection consists of techniques adversaries may use to gather information and the sources information is collected 
                from that are relevant to following through on the adversary's objectives. Frequently, the next goal after collecting 
                data is to steal (exfiltrate) the data. Common target sources include various drive types, browsers, audio, video, and 
                email. Common collection methods include capturing screenshots and keyboard input. <br> 
                Identifies the creation of a subscription in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In GCP, the publisher-subscriber relationship 
                (Pub/Sub) is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples event-producing and event-processing services. A 
                subscription is a named resource representing the stream of messages to be delivered to the subscribing application."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Verify whether the user email, resource name, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment.</li>
    <li>See the logs attached to this alert for more information.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Subscription creations may be done by a system or network administrator.
    Subscription creations by unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated."
