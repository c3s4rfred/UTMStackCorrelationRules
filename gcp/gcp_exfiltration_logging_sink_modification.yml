- name: "GCP probable Exfiltration, Logging Sink Modification"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network. Once they've collected data, 
                adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it. This can include compression and encryption. Techniques for 
                getting data out of a target network typically include transferring it over their command and control channel or an alternate 
                channel and may also include putting size limits on the transmission. <br> 
                Identifies a modification to a Logging sink in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Logging compares the log entry to the sinks 
                in that resource. Each sink whose filter matches the log entry writes a copy of the log entry to the sink's export 
                destination. An adversary may update a Logging sink to exfiltrate logs to a different export destination."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Verify whether the user email, resource name, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment.</li>
    <li>See the logs attached to this alert for more information.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Logging sink modifications may be done by a system or network administrator. 
    Sink modifications from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated."
