- name: "GCP probable Defense Evasion, Logging Sink Deletion"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. 
                Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or 
                obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes 
                to hide and masquerade their malware. Other tactics are cross-listed here when those techniques 
                include the added benefit of subverting defenses. <br> 
                Identifies a Logging sink deletion in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Every time a log entry arrives, Logging 
                compares the log entry to the sinks in that resource. Each sink whose filter matches the log entry writes a 
                copy of the log entry to the sink's export destination. An adversary may delete a Logging sink to evade detection."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Verify whether the user email, resource name, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment.</li>
    <li>See the logs attached to this alert for more information.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Logging sink deletions may be done by a system or network administrator. Logging sink deletions by unfamiliar users or
    hosts should be investigated."
