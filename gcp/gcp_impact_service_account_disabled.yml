- name: "GCP probable Impact, Service Account Disabled"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or compromise integrity by manipulating business 
                and operational processes. Techniques used for impact can include destroying or tampering with data. In some cases, business 
                processes can look fine, but may have been altered to benefit the adversaries goals. These techniques might be used by 
                adversaries to follow through on their end goal or to provide cover for a confidentiality breach. <br> 
                Identifies when a service account is disabled in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). A service account is a special type of 
                account used by an application or a virtual machine (VM) instance, not a person. Applications use service accounts to 
                make authorized API calls, authorized as either the service account itself, or as G Suite or Cloud Identity users 
                through domain-wide delegation. An adversary may disable a service account in order to disrupt to disrupt their target's 
                business operations."
