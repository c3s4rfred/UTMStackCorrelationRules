- name: "GCP probable Defense Evasion, Pub/Sub Subscription Deletion"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. 
                Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or 
                obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes 
                to hide and masquerade their malware. Other tactics are cross-listed here when those techniques 
                include the added benefit of subverting defenses. <br> 
                Identifies the deletion of a subscription in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In GCP, the publisher-subscriber 
                relationship (Pub/Sub) is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples event-producing and event-processing 
                services. A subscription is a named resource representing the stream of messages to be delivered to the subscribing application."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Verify whether the user email, resource name, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment.</li>
    <li>See the logs attached to this alert for more information.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Subscription deletions may be done by a system or network administrator.
    Subscription deletions by unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated."
