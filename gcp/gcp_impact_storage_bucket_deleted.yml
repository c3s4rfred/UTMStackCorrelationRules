- name: "GCP probable Impact, Storage Bucket Deleted"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or compromise integrity by manipulating business 
                and operational processes. Techniques used for impact can include destroying or tampering with data. In some cases, business 
                processes can look fine, but may have been altered to benefit the adversaries goals. These techniques might be used by 
                adversaries to follow through on their end goal or to provide cover for a confidentiality breach. <br> 
                Identifies when a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) storage bucket is deleted. An adversary may delete a storage bucket in 
                order to disrupt their target's business operations."

    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Storage buckets may be deleted by a system or network administrator. Bucket deletions by unfamiliar users or hosts should
    be investigated."
