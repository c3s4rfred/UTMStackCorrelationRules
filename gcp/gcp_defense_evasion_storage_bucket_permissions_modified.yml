- name: "GCP probable Defense Evasion, Storage Bucket Permissions Modification"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. 
                Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or 
                obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes 
                to hide and masquerade their malware. Other tactics are cross-listed here when those techniques 
                include the added benefit of subverting defenses. <br> 
                Identifies when the Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions are modified for a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) 
                storage bucket. An adversary may modify the permissions on a storage bucket to weaken their target's security controls 
                or an administrator may inadvertently modify the permissions, which could lead to data exposure or loss."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Verify that the configuration change was expected.</li>
    <li>See the logs attached to this alert for more information.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Storage bucket permissions may be modified by system administrators. 
    Storage bucket permissions modifications, made by unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated."
