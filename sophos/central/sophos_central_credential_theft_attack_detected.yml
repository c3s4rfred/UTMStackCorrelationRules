- name: "Credential Theft Attemp detected in Sophos Central"
  severity: "High"
  description: "The theft of access credentials to different pages or apps occurs due to the use 
                of insecure passwords, which are used in different accounts. 
                This data is often exposed as a result of leaks that arise from the exploitation of vulnerabilities in different platforms."
  solution: "The first mediated is to generate strong passwords, that is, they combine letters, numbers and signs.
      Another important point is to change the keys frequently and not to use the same keys in all the sites.
      The most important thing is to activate a second authentication factor on all platforms that offer this option."
