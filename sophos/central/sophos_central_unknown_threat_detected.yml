- name: "Unknown Threat detected in Sophos Central"
  severity: "High"
  description: "A computer virus is a piece of malicious code that is prepended or appended to existing files on your computer. 
                Viruses are named after biological viruses because they use similar techniques to spread from one place to another. 
                Virus is often misused to refer to any threat. This usage is gradually being replaced with a more accurate term, malware (malicious software).
                Computer viruses primarly attack executable files and documents. In short, this is how a computer virus works: 
                after running the infected file, the malicious code is called and executed prior to the execution of the original application. 
                A virus can infect any files that the current user has write permissions for.
                Computer viruses can range in purpose and severity. Some of them are extremely dangerous because of their ability to delete files purposely from the hard drive. 
                On the other hand, some viruses do not cause any damage they only serve to annoy the user and demonstrate the technical skills of their authors."
  solution: "Install anti-virus/malware software to keep your PC virus free. Keep your antivirus 
             software up to date. Run regularly scheduled scans with your antivirus software. 
             Keep your operating system up to date. Protect your red."
