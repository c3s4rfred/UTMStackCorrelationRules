- name: "Application Hijacking prevented in Sophos Central"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs. 
                Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time. 
                Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution."
  solution: "Adversaries may use new payloads to execute this technique. Identify and block potentially malicious software executed through hijacking by using 
            application control solutions also capable of blocking libraries loaded by legitimate software."
