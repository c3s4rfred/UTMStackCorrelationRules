- name: "Man in the Middle Attack detected in Sophos Central"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices 
                using an adversary-in-the-middle technique to support follow-on behaviors such as Network Sniffing 
                or Transmitted Data Manipulation. By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine 
                the flow of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate 
                through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions."
  solution: "Disable legacy network protocols that may be used to intercept network traffic if applicable.
      Ensure that all wired and/or wireless traffic is encrypted appropriately.
      Use network appliances and host-based security software to block network traffic that is not necessary 
      within the environment, such as legacy protocols that may be leveraged for AiTM conditions.
      Limit access to network infrastructure and resources that can be used to reshape traffic or otherwise produce AiTM conditions.
      Network intrusion detection and prevention systems that can identify traffic patterns indicative of AiTM activity can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.
      Network segmentation can be used to isolate infrastructure components that do not require broad network access. This may mitigate, or at least alleviate, the scope of AiTM activity."
