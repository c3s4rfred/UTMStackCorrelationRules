  severity: High
  description: "IP spoofing is the creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets which have a modified source address in order to either hide 
                the identity of the sender, to impersonate another computer system, or both. It is a technique often used by bad actors to 
                invoke DDoS attacks against a target device or the surrounding infrastructure."
  solution: "Enable Anti-Spoofing in the Sophos Firewall. To do that see links below."
