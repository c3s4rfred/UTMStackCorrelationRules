  severity: High
  description: "Sophos firewall has detected a probable TCP land attack. A LAND Attack is a Layer 4 Denial of Service (DoS) attack in which, 
               the attacker sets the source and destination information of a TCP segment to be the same. A vulnerable machine will 
               crash or freeze due to the packet being repeatedly processed by the TCP stack. 
               Please see the logs attached to this alert for additional details."
