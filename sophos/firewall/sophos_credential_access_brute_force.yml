- name: "Probable attempts to Brute Force a Sophos authentication components"
  severity: High
  description: "Credential Access consists of techniques for stealing credentials like account names and passwords. Techniques used to get credentials include keylogging 
                or credential dumping. Using legitimate credentials can give adversaries access to systems, make them harder to detect, and provide the opportunity to 
                create more accounts to help achieve their goals.<br>
                Identifies attempts to brute force a Sophos authentication components like: Firewall, VPN, SSL, VPN, Dial-in, MyAccount. 
                An adversary may attempt a brute force attack to obtain unauthorized access to user or services accounts."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Set account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from being guessed. Too strict a policy may create a denial of service condition and render environments un-usable, with all accounts used in the brute force being locked-out.</li>
    <li>Use multi-factor authentication. Where possible, also enable multi-factor authentication on externally facing services.</li>
    <li>Refer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies.</li>
    <li>Proactively reset accounts that are known to be part of breached credentials either immediately, or after detecting bruteforce attempts.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> Automated processes that attempt to authenticate using expired credentials and unbounded retries may lead to false positives."
