# Based on Sophos Firewall 17.5+
# According to documentation message id (Ending part of log_id in logs) 010202130 means: FTP-bounce attack
# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "Probable Sophos FTP-bounce attack"
  severity: High
  description: "Sophos firewall has detected a probable FTP-bounce attack. FTP bounce attack is an exploit of the FTP protocol whereby an attacker 
               is able to use the PORT command to request access to ports indirectly through the use of the victim machine, which serves as 
               a proxy for the request, similar to an Open mail relay using SMTP.
               This technique can be used to port scan hosts discreetly, and to potentially bypass a network Access-control list to access 
               specific ports that the attacker cannot access through a direct connection, for example with the nmap port scanner.
               Please see the logs attached to this alert for additional details."
  solution: "<ol>
    <li>Enable ftpbounce-prevention in sophos firewall.</li>
    <li>Use a data loss prevention (DLP) strategy to categorize sensitive data, identify data formats indicative of personal identifiable information (PII), and restrict exfiltration of sensitive data.</li>
    <li>Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic..</li>
    <li>Use intrusion detection signatures to block traffic at network boundaries.</li>
    <li>Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Configure separate virtual private cloud (VPC) instances to isolate critical cloud systems.</li>
