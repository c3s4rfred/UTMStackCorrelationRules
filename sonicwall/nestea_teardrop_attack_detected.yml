- name: "Nestea/Teardrop Attack Detected"
  severity: "High"
  description: "A teardrop attack is a denial of service (DoS) attack that involves sending fragmented packets to a target machine. 
                Since the machine receiving such packets cannot reassemble them due to a TCP/IP fragmentation reassembly error, 
                the packets overlap each other, blocking the destination network device."
  solution: "You can protect your network against DoS attacks for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic by configuring the appropriate DoS Settings on the SonicWall Firewall."
  category: "Impact"
