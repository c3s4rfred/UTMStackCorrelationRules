- name: "TCP Null Flag Attack dropped"
  severity: "High"
  description: "In case of TCP Null Attack, the victim server gets packets with null parameters in the flag field of the TCP header, i.e. none of the 6 TCP flags (URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, FIN) is set. 
                As a rule, packets of this kind are used to scan the serverâ€™s ports before a large-scale attack."
  solution: "If you have been the victim of this type of attack, the best strategy is to immediately request protection for your website or server."
