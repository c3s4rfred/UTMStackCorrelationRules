- name: "Possible ICMP Flood Attack detected by SonicWall Firewall"
  severity: "High"
  description: "A ICMP flood is a type of denial-of-service attack in which a large number of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) 
                packets are sent to a target server in order to overload that device's ability to process and respond. 
                The firewall protecting the target server can also be overwhelmed as a result of the ICMP flood, causing a denial of service to legitimate traffic."
  solution: "You can protect your network against DoS attacks for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic by configuring the appropriate DoS Settings on the SonicWall Firewall."
  category: "Impact"
