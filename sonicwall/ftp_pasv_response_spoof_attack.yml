- name: "FTP Passive Attack blocked by SonicWall firewall"
  severity: "High"
  description: "The SonicWall appliance has detected and blocked a possible PASV (passive) response bounce denial of service attack. 
                FTP PASV response packets can be spoofed to allow an attacker to establish arbitrary TCP connections to FTP servers or clients located behind some firewalls."
  solution: "We recommend using tools such as firewalls, vpn and antivirus. Creating strong passwords will help keep IP spoofers away from your devices."
