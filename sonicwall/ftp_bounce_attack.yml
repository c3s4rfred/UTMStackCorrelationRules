- name: "FTP: Bounce attack detected"
  severity: "High"
  description: "FTP bounce attack is an exploit of the FTP protocol whereby an attacker is able to use the PORT command to request access to ports indirectly through the use of the victim machine, 
                which serves as a proxy for the request, similar to an Open mail relay using SMTP
                This technique can be used to port scan hosts discreetly, and to potentially bypass a network Access-control list to access specific ports that the attacker cannot access through a direct connection"
  solution: "Each open port is a potential gateway to the equipment, so it is necessary to take certain security measures.
      One of them is not to open more ports than necessary. Normally, the equipment already comes with a series of default open ports to be able to offer the basic services and functions.
      It is also advisable to use a firewall or packet filters, which work as a barrier that protects the computer from intruders.
      Another recommendation is to always keep equipment and systems updated to the latest version, since developers often create patches that correct possible vulnerabilities.
      Finally, there is the option of using tools that allow us to detect when our ports are being scanned."
