- name: "ARP spoof attack detected by SonicWall firewall"
  severity: "High"
  description: "ARP Spoofing is the poisoning of ARP tables. It is a technique hackers use to gain entry into a network to steal data packets passing through the local network. 
                This way he could control the traffic and also even stop it.
                Cybercriminals can send spoofed ARP messages to a LAN. It manages to link your MAC address with the IP address of a server.
                From that moment on, it would begin to receive any type of information that you enter through that IP address and be able to take complete control of the traffic.
                Therefore we can say that ARP spoofing consists of sending false ARP messages to the Ethernet. 
                It associates, for simplicity's sake, the attacker's MAC address with the IP address and gets the information to the attacker."
  solution: "We recommend using tools to prevent ARP spoofing, such as firewalls, vpn and antivirus. Creating strong passwords will help keep ARP spoofers away from your devices."
