- name: "Possible SHLO Replay Attack detected"
  severity: "High"
  description: "A replay attack is a form of network attack in which valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed. 
                This is carried out either by the originator or by an adversary who intercepts the data and re-transmits it, possibly as part of a spoofing attack by IP packet substitution. "
  solution: "One Time Passwords or OTPs are the most secure way to protect yourself online. Log in to websites with HTTPS protocols enabled. 
      Virtual Private Networks or VPNs send traffic data to you through separate tunnels with a good level of encryption. 
      Nobody can read the data that is transferred through the VPN tunnels."
