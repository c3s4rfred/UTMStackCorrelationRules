- name: "Rogue or MitM Access Point found"
  severity: "High"
  description: "A man in the middle computer attack occurs when a hacker intervenes in the transmission of data between two parties that carry out an electronic communication. 
                The cybercriminal pretends to be either or both of them, hijacking the data and making believe the parties that are communicating with each other, 
                when in reality this is not the case, and it is the hackers who act as an intermediary of that communication.
                Rogue software is a type of malicious computer program whose main purpose is to make believe that a computer is infected by some type of virus, making the user pay a large sum of money."
  solution: "We recommend keeping your antivirus and antispyware updated. Use virtual private networks that allow you to browse anonymously and that information travels encrypted.
      Do not connect to public Wi-Fi networks.
      Be aware of the methods cybercriminals use to carry out scams such as phishing.
      Have the operating system and browser updated to the latest version.
      Access only web pages that have an SSL certificate and use the HTTPS protocol.
      Make sure that the services or apps you use to communicate use end-to-end encryption.
      If you are an administrator, update the server software."
