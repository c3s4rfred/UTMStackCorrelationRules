- name: "Port Scan detected by SonicWall firewall"
  severity: "High"
  description: "What an attacker does is automatically analyze all the ports of a device, such as a computer, that is connected to the network. 
                What they are looking for is to detect possible open ports and which ones could have deficient security protocols.
                Once they obtain all the information possible, they could detect possible security holes and thus carry out their attacks. 
                They could obtain sensitive information from users, know data about the operating system of that computer, etc.
                This can be a very important entry point for hackers. As we say, once they are inside the network, from that computer, 
                they could steal information, have access to passwords and, ultimately, compromise our privacy."
  solution: "Each open port is a potential gateway to the equipment, so it is necessary to take certain security measures.
      One of them is not to open more ports than necessary. Normally, the equipment already comes with a series of default open ports to be able to offer the basic services and functions.
      It is also advisable to use a firewall or packet filters, which work as a barrier that protects the computer from intruders.
      Another recommendation is to always keep equipment and systems updated to the latest version, since developers often create patches that correct possible vulnerabilities.
      Finally, there is the option of using tools that allow us to detect when our ports are being scanned."
