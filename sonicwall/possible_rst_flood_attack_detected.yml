- name: "Possible RST flood attack detected by SonicWall Firewall"
  severity: "High"
  description: "A RST flood is a DDoS attack designed to disrupt network activity by saturating bandwidth and resources on stateful devices in its path.
                By continuously sending RST packets towards a target, stateful defenses can go down (In some cases into a fail open mode). 
                This flood could also be used as a smoke screen for more advanced attacks. This is true for other out of state floods too."
  solution: "You can protect your network against DoS attacks for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic by configuring the appropriate DoS Settings on the SonicWall Firewall."
