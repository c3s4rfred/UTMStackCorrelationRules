- name: "Smurf attack detected by SonicWall firewall"
  severity: "High"
  description: "The attacker tries to flood a target server with Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets. 
                By making requests with the targeted device's spoofed IP address to one or more computer networks, 
                the networks respond to the server, amplifying the initial attack traffic and potentially overloading the target, rendering it inaccessible."
  solution: "You can protect your network against DoS attacks for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic by configuring the appropriate DoS Settings on the SonicWall Firewall."
  category: "Impact"
  tactic: "Network Denial of Service"
