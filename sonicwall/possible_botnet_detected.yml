- name: "Posible Botnet detected or blocked"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that can be used during targeting. 
                A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks. 
                Instead of purchasing/renting a botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising numerous third-party systems. 
                Adversaries may also conduct a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 servers. 
                With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale Phishing or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)."
  solution: "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls."
