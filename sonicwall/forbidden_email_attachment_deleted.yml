  description: "Adversaries may target user email to collect sensitive information. 
                Emails may contain sensitive data, including trade secrets or personal information, that can prove valuable to adversaries. 
                Adversaries can collect or forward email from mail servers or clients."
  solution: "Use of encryption provides an added layer of security to sensitive information sent over email. 
      Encryption using public key cryptography requires the adversary to obtain the private certificate along with an encryption key to decrypt messages.
      Use of multi-factor authentication for public-facing webmail servers is a recommended best practice to minimize the usefulness of usernames and passwords to adversaries."
