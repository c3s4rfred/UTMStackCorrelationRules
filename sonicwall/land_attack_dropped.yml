- name: "Land attack detected by SonicWall firewall"
  severity: "High"
  description: "The attacker sets the source and destination information of a TCP segment to be the same. A vulnerable machine will crash or freeze due to the packet being repeatedly processed by the TCP stack."
  solution: "When flood volumes exceed the capacity of the targeted network connection, it is typically necessary to intercept incoming upstream traffic to filter attack traffic from legitimate traffic.
      Depending on the volume of the flood, local filtering may be possible by blocking the source addresses that originate the attack, 
      blocking the ports that are targeted, or blocking the protocols that are used for transport."
  category: "Impact"
