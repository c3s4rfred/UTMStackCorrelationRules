- name: "IP spoof attack detected and blocked by SonicWall firewall"
  severity: "High"
  description: "The attacker can create Internet Protocol (IP) packets with a modified source address in order to hide the identity of the sender, impersonate another computer system, or both. 
                It is a technique commonly used by malicious actors to implement DDoS attacks against a target device or the surrounding infrastructure."
  solution: "We recommend using tools to prevent IP spoofing, such as firewalls, vpn and antivirus. Creating strong passwords will help keep IP spoofers away from your devices."
