- name: "Ping of death attack detected and blocked by SonicWall firewall"
  severity: "High"
  description: "The attacker sends a malicious data packet to the recipient. When the target system tries to process it, an error is generated that crashes the system."
  solution: "When flood volumes exceed the capacity of the targeted network connection, it is typically necessary to intercept incoming upstream traffic to filter attack traffic from legitimate traffic.
      Depending on the volume of the flood, local filtering may be possible by blocking the source addresses that originate the attack, 
      blocking the ports that are targeted, or blocking the protocols that are used for transport."
  category: "Impact"
