- name: "Possible FIN flood attack detected by SonicWall Firewall"
  severity: "High"
  description: "FIN Flood is a DDoS attack aimed at consuming computing power and saturating bandwidth. 
                FIN Floods are generally spoofed attacks and normally come at a very high rate.
                FIN floods, if not dropped by stateful devices on the perimeter, may overwhelm the internal network architecture. 
                Generally this flood is used as a basic but effective flood to bring down perimeter devices or saturate bandwidth."
  solution: "You can protect your network against DoS attacks for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic by configuring the appropriate DoS Settings on the SonicWall Firewall."
