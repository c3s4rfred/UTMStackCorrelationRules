- name: "DNS Rebind Attack Detected or Blocked"
  severity: "High"
  description: "DNS rebinding or DNS rebinding is a DNS-based computer attack where the attacker takes advantage of a vulnerability to transform the computer into a network proxy. 
                For this, it uses code embedded in web pages, taking advantage of the browsers same-origin policy ."
  solution: "We recommend setting an IP address to the value received in the first DNS response. This technique can block some legitimate uses of dynamic DNS.
      Blocking the resolution of external names to internal addresses on the organization's local name servers.
      Servers can reject HTTP requests with an unrecognizable Host header."
