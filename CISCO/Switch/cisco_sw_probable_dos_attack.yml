- name: "Probable denial of service (DoS) attack, detected by CISCO IOS"
  severity: "High"
  description: "A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to the intended users.
                One common method of attack involves saturating the target machine with external communications requests so that it cannot
                respond to legitimate traffic or the machine responds so slowly that it is essentially useless."
  solution: "Check the logs attached to this alert to verify if is a device malfunction, strict configuration or is part of an attack, the source should be shunned until this behaviour is verified. See the URLs below for more information"
