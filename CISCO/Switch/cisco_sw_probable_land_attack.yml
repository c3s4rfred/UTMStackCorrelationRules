- name: "Probable Land attack, detected by CISCO IOS"
  severity: "High"
  description: "A LAND Attack is a Layer 4 Denial of Service (DoS) attack in which, 
               the attacker sets the source and destination information of a TCP segment to be the same. A vulnerable machine will 
               crash or freeze due to the packet being repeatedly processed by the TCP stack. 
               This triggers when an IP packet arrives with source equal to destination address."
  solution: "Resistant implementations check for the destination information to be different then the source information. Mitigation techniques include installing patches on the vulnerable systems or using a firewall configured to filter out LAND packets. Check the logs attached to this alert and URLs below for more information."
