- name: "Probable SYN Flood attack, detected by CISCO IOS"
  severity: "High"
  description: "A SYN flood (half-open attack) is a type of denial-of-service (DDoS) attack which aims to make a 
                server unavailable to legitimate traffic by consuming all available server resources. By repeatedly 
                sending initial connection request (SYN) packets, the attacker is able to overwhelm all available 
                ports on a targeted server machine, causing the targeted device to respond to legitimate traffic 
                sluggishly or not at all."
  solution: "Check the logs attached to this alert to verify if is a device malfunction, strict configuration or is part of an attack.
