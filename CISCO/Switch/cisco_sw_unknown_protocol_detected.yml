  description: "Triggers when an IP datagram is received with the protocol field set to 101 or greater. The use of these protocol types is highly unusual and should be investigated."
  solution: "Locally developed protocols that may use these protocol types will trigger the signature. The use of these protocol types is highly unusual and should be investigated. When on-specific network traffic of this type is encountered, the most prudent action from a security perspective is to shun or disallow it. See the logs attached to this alert for more information."
