- name: "Probable replay attack, detected by CISCO IOS"
  severity: "High"
  description: "A replay attack occurs when a cybercriminal eavesdrops on a secure network communication, intercepts it, and then fraudulently delays or resends it to misdirect the receiver into doing what the hacker wants. The added danger of replay attacks is that a hacker doesn't even need advanced skills to decrypt a message after capturing it from the network. The attack could be successful simply by resending the whole thing."
  solution: "We recommend you to investigate the reason the event was generated. Your network may be under attack and the
             source should be shunned until you verify. Check the logs attached to this alert for more information"
