- name: "Probable security attack, detected by CISCO IOS"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "LU-LU verification failed. The partner LU has sent an incorrect response to a challenge sent by a local LU. This is either a mismatch in configuration or a security attack. Session activation will fail."
  solution: "See the logs attached to this alert and check the identity of the partner LU. If this is a mismatch in configuration then reconfigure the password either at the local LU or at the partner LU (or at both LUs), so that both LUs have the same password. 
             See the URL below for more information."
