- name: "Probable CISCO Firepower SYN Flood attack"
  severity: "High"
  description: "A SYN flood (half-open attack) is a type of denial-of-service (DDoS) attack which aims to make a 
                server unavailable to legitimate traffic by consuming all available server resources. By repeatedly 
                sending initial connection request (SYN) packets, the attacker is able to overwhelm all available 
                ports on a targeted server machine, causing the targeted device to respond to legitimate traffic 
                sluggishly or not at all."
