- name: "Probable CISCO Firepower TCP land attack"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Firewall has detected a TCP land attack. A LAND Attack is a Layer 4 Denial of Service (DoS) attack in which, 
               the attacker sets the source and destination information of a TCP segment to be the same. A vulnerable machine will 
               crash or freeze due to the packet being repeatedly processed by the TCP stack. 
               Please see the logs attached to this alert for additional details."
  solution: "If this message persists, an attack may be in progress. The packet does not provide enough information to determine where the attack originates. Contact your administrator."
