- name: "Probable CISCO Firepower IP spoofing attack"
  severity: "High"
  description: "IP spoofing is the creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets which have a modified source address in order to either hide 
                the identity of the sender, to impersonate another computer system, or both. It is a technique often used by bad actors to 
                invoke DDoS attacks against a target device or the surrounding infrastructure."
  solution: "Enable Unicast RPF with the ip verify reverse-path command, check the <strong>vpnclient mac-exempt</strong> command on the Firepower Threat Defense device<br>
     <strong>Potential false positive: </strong> In case of FTD-4-405002 traffic might be legitimate, or it might indicate that a spoofing attack is inprogress.
             Check the source MAC address and IP address to determine where the packets are coming from and if they belong to a valid host."
