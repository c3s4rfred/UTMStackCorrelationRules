- name: "Probable CISCO Firepower denial of service (DoS) attack"
  severity: "High"
  description: "A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to the intended users.
                One common method of attack involves saturating the target machine with external communications requests so that it cannot
                respond to legitimate traffic or the machine responds so slowly that it is essentially useless."
  solution: "You can protect your network against DoS attacks configuring Threat Defense in the CISCO Firepower. Also:
          <ol>
           <li>In case of FTD-1-106101, check <strong>log</strong> option for an ACL <strong>deny</strong> statement (<strong>access-list</strong> <i>id</i> <strong>deny</strong> command) and user-configured limit (using the <strong>access-list deny-flow-max</strong> command)</li>
           <li>In case of FTD-4-209003, too many IP fragments are currently awaiting reassembly, see <strong>fragment size</strong> command. To prevent fragmentation, see the <strong>sysopt connection tcpmss bytes</strong> command. If this message persists, a denial of service (DoS) attack might be in progress. Contact the remote peer administrator or upstream provider.</li>
           <li>In case of FTD-5-402128, an SSL connection is attempting to use more memory than allowed. The request has been denied.  If this message persists, an SSL denial of service attack may be in progress. Contact the remote peer administrator or upstream provider.</li>
           <li>In case of FTD-4-407002, might indicate legitimate traffic or that a DoS attack is in progress. Check the source address to determine where the packets are coming from and whether or not a valid host is sending them.</li>
          </ol>"
