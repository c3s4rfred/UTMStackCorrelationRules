- name: "Probable CISCO ASA Defense Evasion using FTP port command"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "The adversary is trying to avoid being detected. Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. 
                Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. 
                Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware. Other techniques are cross-listed 
                here when those techniques include the added benefit of subverting defenses.
                In this case someone is using an FTP port command in a wrong way to attempt to avert the site security policy.
                Please see the logs attached to this alert for additional details."
  solution: "The Secure Firewall ASA drops the packet, terminates the connection, and logs the event. No actions required."
