# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "System Linux: File Deletion via Shred"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "Malware or other files dropped or created on a system by an adversary may leave traces behind as to what was done within
                a network and how. Adversaries may remove these files over the course of an intrusion to keep their footprint low or
                remove them at the end as part of the post-intrusion cleanup process."
  solution: "This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features."
