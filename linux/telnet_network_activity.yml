- name: "System Linux: Connection to External Network via Telnet"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Telnet provides a command line interface for communication with a remote device or server. This rule identifies Telnet
                network connections to publicly routable IP addresses."
  solution: "Use multi-factor authentication on remote service logons where possible.
      Limit the accounts that may use remote services. 
      Limit the permissions for accounts that are at higher risk of compromise; for example, configure SSH so users can only run specific programs."
