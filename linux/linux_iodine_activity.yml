# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "System Linux: Potential DNS Tunneling via Iodine"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Iodine is a tool for tunneling Internet protocol version 4 (IPV4) traffic over the DNS protocol to circumvent firewalls,
                network security groups, and network access lists while evading detection."
  solution: "Filter network traffic to prevent use of protocols across the network boundary that are unnecessary. 	
      Network intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.
      Properly configure firewalls and proxies to limit outgoing traffic to only necessary ports and through proper network gateway systems. 
      Also ensure hosts are only provisioned to communicate over authorized interfaces."
