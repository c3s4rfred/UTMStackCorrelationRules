- name: "System Linux: Abnormal Process ID or Lock File Created"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies the creation of a Process ID (PID), lock or reboot file created in temporary file storage paradigm (tmpfs)
                directory /var/run. On Linux, the PID files typically hold the process ID to track previous copies running and manage
                other tasks. Certain Linux malware use the /var/run directory for holding data, executables and other tasks, disguising
                itself or these files as legitimate PID files."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).
      Take actions to terminate processes and connections used by the attacker.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
