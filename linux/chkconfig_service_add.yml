- name: "System Linux: Chkconfig Service Add"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Detects the use of the chkconfig binary to manually add a service for management by chkconfig. 
                Threat actors may utilize this technique to maintain persistence on a system. 
                When a new service is added, chkconfig ensures that the service has either a start 
                or a kill entry in every runlevel and when the system is rebooted the service file added will run providing long-term persistence."
  solution: "Limit privileges of user accounts so only authorized users can edit the rc.common file."
