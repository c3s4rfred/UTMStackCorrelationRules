# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "System Linux: System Log File Deletion"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies the deletion of sensitive Linux system logs. This may indicate an attempt to evade detection or destroy
                forensic evidence on a system."
  solution: "Obfuscate/encrypt event files locally and in transit to avoid giving feedback to an adversary.	
      Automatically forward events to a log server or data repository to prevent conditions in which the adversary can locate and manipulate data on the local system. 
      When possible, minimize time delay on event reporting to avoid prolonged storage on the local system.
      Protect generated event files that are stored locally with proper permissions and authentication and limit opportunities for adversaries to increase privileges by preventing Privilege Escalation opportunities."
