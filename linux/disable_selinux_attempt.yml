- name: "System Linux: Potential Disabling of SELinux"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies potential attempts to disable Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux), which is a Linux kernel security feature to
                support access control policies. Adversaries may disable security tools to avoid possible detection of their tools and activities."
  solution: "Use application control where appropriate, especially regarding the execution of tools outside of the organization's security policies  
      that have been abused to impair system defenses. Ensure that only approved security applications are used and running on enterprise systems. 
      Ensure proper process and file permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security services. 
      Ensure proper Registry permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security services. 
      Ensure proper user permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security services."
