# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "System Linux: Nping Process Activity"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Some normal use of this command may originate from security engineers and network or server administrators, but this
                is usually not routine or unannounced. Use of Nping by non-engineers or ordinary users is uncommon."
  solution: "Ensure that unnecessary ports and services are closed to prevent risk of discovery and potential exploitation.
      Use network intrusion detection/prevention systems to detect and prevent remote service scans.
      Ensure proper network segmentation is followed to protect critical servers and devices."
