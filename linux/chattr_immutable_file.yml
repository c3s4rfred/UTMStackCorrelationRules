- name: "System Linux: File made Immutable by Chattr"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Detects a file being made immutable using the chattr binary. 
                Making a file immutable means it cannot be deleted or renamed, no link can be created to this file, 
                most of the file is metadata can not be modified, and the file can not be opened in write mode. 
                Threat actors will commonly utilize this to prevent tampering or modification of their malicious 
                files or any system files they have modified for purposes of persistence"
  solution: "Ensure critical system files as well as those known to be abused by adversaries have restrictive 
        permissions and are owned by an appropriately privileged account, especially if access is not required by users nor will inhibit system functionality."
