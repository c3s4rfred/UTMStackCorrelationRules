- name: "System Linux: File Transfer or Listener Established via Netcat"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "A netcat process is engaging in network activity on a Linux host. Netcat is often used as a persistence mechanism by
                exporting a reverse shell or by serving a shell on a listening port. Netcat is also sometimes used for data
                exfiltration."
  solution: "Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are
      identified. Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials, such as email, business systems, and web services.
      Block the identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).
      Take actions to terminate processes and connections used by the attacker.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
