- name: "System Linux: Dynamic Linker Copy"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Detects the copying of the Linux dynamic loader binary and subsequent file creation for the purpose of creating a backup copy. 
                This technique was seen recently being utilized by Linux malware prior to patching the dynamic loader in order to inject and preload a malicious shared object file. 
                This activity should never occur and if it does then it should be considered highly suspicious or malicious."
  solution: "Adversaries may use new payloads to execute this technique. 
      Identify and block potentially malicious software executed through hijacking by using application control solutions also capable of blocking libraries loaded by legitimate software."
