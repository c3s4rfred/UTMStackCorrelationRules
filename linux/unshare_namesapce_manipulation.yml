- name: "System Linux: Namespace Manipulation Using Unshare"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies  suspicious usage of unshare to manipulate system namespaces. Unshare can be utilized to escalate privileges
                or escape container security boundaries. Threat actors have utilized this binary to allow themselves to escape to the
                host and access other resources or escalate privileges."
  solution: "Use auditing tools capable of detecting privilege and service abuse opportunities on systems within an enterprise and correct them.
      Enforce registration and execution of only legitimately signed service drivers where possible. Installation	
      Restrict software installation to trusted repositories only and be cautious of orphaned software packages.
      Restrict read/write access to system-level process files to only select privileged users who have a legitimate need to manage system services.	
      Limit privileges of user accounts and groups so that only authorized administrators can interact with system-level process changes and service configurations."
