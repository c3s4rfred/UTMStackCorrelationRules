# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "System Linux: Potential Protocol Tunneling via EarthWorm"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies the execution of the EarthWorm tunneler. Adversaries may tunnel network communications to and from a victim
                system within a separate protocol to avoid detection and network filtering, or to enable access to otherwise unreachable systems."
  solution: "Filter network traffic to prevent use of protocols across the network boundary that are unnecessary. 	
      Network intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.
      Properly configure firewalls and proxies to limit outgoing traffic to only necessary ports and through proper network gateway systems. 
      Also ensure hosts are only provisioned to communicate over authorized interfaces."
