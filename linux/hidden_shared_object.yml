  description: "Identifies the creation of a hidden shared object file. Users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a . as the first character in the file or folder name.
                Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders on the system for persistence and defense evasion."
  solution: "This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of system features."
