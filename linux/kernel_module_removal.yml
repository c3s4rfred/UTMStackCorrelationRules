# Rule version v1.0.1

- name: "System Linux: Kernel Module Removal"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the
                functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. This rule identifies attempts to remove a kernel module."
  solution: "Use application control where appropriate, especially regarding the execution of tools outside of the organization's security policies that have been abused to impair system defenses. 
      Ensure proper process and file permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security services.
      Ensure proper Registry permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security services.	
      Ensure proper user permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security services."
