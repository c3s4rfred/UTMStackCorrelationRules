- name: "System Linux: Possible Brute Force Attack"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "Identifies multiple SSH login failures followed by a successful one from the same source address. Adversaries can attempt
                to login into multiple users with a common or known password to gain access to accounts."
  solution: "Ensure active session(s) on the host(s) are terminated as the attacker could have gained initial access to the system(s).
      Isolate the involved hosts to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
      Investigate credential exposure on systems compromised or used by the attacker to ensure all compromised accounts are identified.
      Reset passwords for these accounts and other potentially compromised credentials.
      Run a full antimalware scan. This may reveal additional artifacts left in the system, persistence mechanisms, and malware components.
      Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector."
