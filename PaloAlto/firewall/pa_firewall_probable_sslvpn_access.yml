- name: "Probable access through vpn or sslvpn detected by Palo Alto Firewall"
  severity: "High"
  description: "The firewall has detected an access using vpn or sslvpn. It's easy to exhaust resources on VPNs and associated firewalls, 
               even with a low volume distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. Attackers can send a small amount of Transmission Control 
               Protocol (TCP) packets with the SYN flag checked, another batch of TCP packets with the ACK flag, and another set with the URG 
               flag, and so on to bring down your network firewalls until they can no longer handle any new connections. These DDoS attacks are 
               difficult to detect because they don't trigger the volume threshold of VPN connections.
               Additionally, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPNs are vulnerable to SSL flood attacks just like your web servers; in this type of attack, 
               the attackers try to exhaust the VPN server resources using a high volume of SSL handshake requests."
  solution: "<ol>
             <li>Monitor VPN connections on different devices and tune thresholds accurately to capture abnormal activities.</li>
             <li>Check your Zone Protection and DoS Protection configuration in the Firewall.</li>
             <li>Check your Authentication configuration in the Firewall, use multifactor authentication to protect sensitive services and applications.</li>
             <li>Check if it is an allowed access to the network or part of an attack.</li>
             <li>See the logs attached to this alert for more information.</li>
             </ol>"
