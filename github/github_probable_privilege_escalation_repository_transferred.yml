- name: "GitHub, Probable Privilege Escalation, the ownership of a repository was transferred"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level 
                permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network 
                with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their 
                objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, 
                and vulnerabilities."
