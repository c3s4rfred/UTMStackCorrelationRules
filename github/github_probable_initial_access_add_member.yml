- name: "GitHub, probable Initial Access, member added to repository"
  severity: "Low"
  description: "The adversary is trying to get into your network. Initial Access consists of techniques 
                that use various entry vectors to gain their initial foothold within a network. 
                Techniques used to gain a foothold include targeted spearphishing and exploiting 
                weaknesses on public-facing web servers. Footholds gained through initial access may 
                allow for continued access, like valid accounts and use of external remote services, 
                or may be limited-use due to changing passwords.
                When a member is added, gain access to repository, so he can see and modify the code"
  solution: "<ol>
             <li>Check if the member addition is allowed in this case.</li>
             <li>See the logs attached to this alert for more information.</li>
             </ol><br>
             <strong>Potential false positive: </strong>Add members to repository, may be 
             performed by a repository or organization administrator. Verify who is making the changes."
