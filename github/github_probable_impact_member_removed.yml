- name: "GitHub, probable Impact, member removed from repository"
  severity: "High"
  description: "The adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems and data. 
                Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or compromise 
                integrity by manipulating business and operational processes. Techniques used for impact 
                can include destroying or tampering with data. In some cases, business processes can look 
                fine, but may have been altered to benefit the adversaries' goals. These techniques might 
                be used by adversaries to follow through on their end goal or to provide cover for a 
                confidentiality breach.
                When a member is removed from repository, loses access to repository, so he can't collaborate any more"
  solution: "<ol>
             <li>Check if the member removal is allowed in this case.</li>
             <li>See the logs attached to this alert for more information.</li>
             </ol><br>
             <strong>Potential false positive: </strong>Remove a member from repository, may be 
             performed by a repository or organization administrator. Verify who is making the changes."
