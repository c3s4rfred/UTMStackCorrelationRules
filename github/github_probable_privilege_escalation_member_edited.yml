- name: "GitHub, probable Privilege Escalation, repository member edited"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level 
                permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network 
                with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their 
                objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, 
                and vulnerabilities.
                When a member is edited, may have changes in the access permission to repository, so he can gain
                more privileges or lose them. If the change remove privileges, may be an <strong>Impact - Account Access Removal</strong>
                not Privilege Escalation"
  solution: "<ol>
             <li>Check if the member edition is allowed in this case.</li>
             <li>See the logs attached to this alert for more information.</li>
             </ol><br>
             <strong>Potential false positive: </strong>Edit members, may be 
             performed by a repository or organization administrator. Verify who is making the changes."
