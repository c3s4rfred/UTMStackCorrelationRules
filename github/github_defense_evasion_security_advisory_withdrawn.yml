- name: "GitHub, probable Defense Evasion, security advisory withdrawn"
  severity: "High"
  description: "The adversary is trying to avoid being detected. Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. 
                Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. 
                Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware. Other tacticsâ€™ techniques are cross-listed 
                here when those techniques include the added benefit of subverting defenses.
                If the security advisory is withdrawn you won't be able to see alerts related to 
                this security advisory"

             <li>See the logs attached to this alert for more information.</li>
