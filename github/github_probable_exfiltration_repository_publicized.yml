- name: "GitHub, probable Exfiltration, repository publicized"
  severity: "High"
  description: "Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network. 
                Once they've collected data, adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it. 
                This can include compression and encryption. Techniques for getting data out of a target network 
                typically include transferring it over their command and control channel or an alternate channel 
                and may also include putting size limits on the transmission.
                Public repositories are accessible to everyone on the internet, so anyone can clone your repository
                and have a copy of your work"
