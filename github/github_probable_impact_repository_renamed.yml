- name: "Probable Impact, repository renamed on GitHub"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "The adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems and data. 
                Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or compromise 
                integrity by manipulating business and operational processes. Techniques used for impact 
                can include destroying or tampering with data. In some cases, business processes can look 
                fine, but may have been altered to benefit the adversaries' goals. These techniques might 
                be used by adversaries to follow through on their end goal or to provide cover for a 
                confidentiality breach.
                When you rename a repository, all existing information, with the exception of project site URLs, 
                is automatically redirected to the new name, but some components can be affected by the rename, like: 
                Pages and actions; GitHub will not redirect calls to an action hosted by a renamed repository. 
                Any workflow that uses that action will fail with the error <strong>repository not found</strong>.
                With rename, path to code changes, so this could lead to application failures"

             <li>Check if the repository rename action is allowed in this case.</li>
