- name: "GitHub, probable Impact, repository privatized"
  severity: "Medium"
  description: "The adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems and data. 
                Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or compromise 
                integrity by manipulating business and operational processes. Techniques used for impact 
                can include destroying or tampering with data. In some cases, business processes can look 
                fine, but may have been altered to benefit the adversaries' goals. These techniques might 
                be used by adversaries to follow through on their end goal or to provide cover for a 
                confidentiality breach.
                Private repositories are only accessible to you, administrators, people you explicitly share access with, 
                and, for organization repositories, certain organization members. If you make a repository private
                may be some contributors can lost the access to the repository."
